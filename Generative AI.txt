GPT (Generative Pre-Training Transformer)

1. AI
2. ML
3. DL
4. GEN AI

ARCHITECTURE
GPT - LLM <--- Transformers <--- LSTM(Long-Short Term Memory) <--- RNN(Recurrent Neural Network) <--- ANN <--- DL(DEEP Learning)

Steps of ML Life cycles
Collect the data
2. Preprocess the data
3. Split the model in TRAIN and TEST
4. Design the ML model
5. Train the model
6. Test the model
7. Deploy the model
8. Monitor

Supervised Learning
-------------------------------------
it is of two types
1. Regression - means which varies 
2. Classification - Means which classify the data as per needs
